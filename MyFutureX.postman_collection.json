All rights reserved. 1 of 2 Prophylactic mRNA vaccines Part 1 •   Prophylactic vaccines are used to prevent disease •   Vaccines work by exposing our immune system to a new infectious agent: –   Antigen presenting cells (APCs) display antigens, or foreign proteins, on their surface –   When the antigen is recognized by immune cells:    B cells mature and secrete antibodies specific to the pathogen    Cytotoxic T cells seek out the infection to eliminate it –   mRNA vaccines use the LNP to provide APCs with the instructions to make the antigenic protein themselves •   Because a majority of the material required to create a complete pathogen is not present in mRNA vaccines, there is no way they can cause an active infection Prophylactic mRNA vaccines Part 2 •   mRNA vaccines can be multiplexed which means: –   Combination vaccines can provide mRNA sequences for multiple infectious agents in one medicine –   A vaccine can be produced even if the antigen is a multiprotein complex •   mRNA vaccines are limited by the maximum tolerated dose, or the largest amount of LNP that can be dosed without causing severe side effects: –   Each mRNA sequence has its own potency –   Therefore, multiplexed vaccines are limited by the total amount of mRNA needed to elicit an appropriate immune response, not the number of different mRNA sequences •   Advantages of mRNA vaccine development: –   Can be made using equipment the size of a large refrigerator –   Can be produced very quickly, helping to avoid genetic drift and, thus, increasing their efficacy –   The component materials for both mRNAs and LNPs are the same, regardless of mRNA sequence •   Disadvantages of mRNA vaccines: –   mRNA is relatively fragile –   Must be kept at low temperatures to slow degradation •   Formulation modifications (e.g., lyophilization, microneedle patches) may help preserve vaccine potency mRNA therapeutics that stimulate the immune system •   Individualized neoantigen therapies (INTs; aka personalized cancer vaccines): –   Train the immune system to recognize an individual’s unique cancer by activating the body’s immune response to recognize neoantigens –   Are created by sequencing patient tissue samples for neoantigen mutations and designing mRNAs that encode the neoantigen –   Must be administered multiple times for optimal immune response, similar to prophylactic vaccines   Mark as completed Go to next item Like Dislike Report an issue\\nLesson type: READING\\nLesson URL: https://www.coursera.org/programs/national-elearning-center-learning-program-axbbe?showMiniModal=true&attemptSSOLogin=true&productType=course&productId=lCUJ1UOYEe-3kxKNpReWGQ&itemId=Lg4bf\\n\\n**Content 12**\\nModule name: Module 2: Learning About Medicines\\nLesson title: What makes mRNA suitable as a medicine?\\nLesson subtitle: What makes mRNA suitable as a medicine?\\nLesson content: taking the medicine. Let's check to see whether mRNA has the right features to be an ideal medicine. Unlike DNA, which serves as the permanent repository of your genetic information, both proteins and mRNAs are inherently transient. With very few exceptions, most proteins are under constant flux. They have limited lifetimes and must be regularly replenished. Likewise, the instructions for making them, the mRNAs are constantly made and destroyed, only to be remade again.\\nLesson type: VIDEO\\nLesson URL: https://www.coursera.org/programs/national-elearning-center-learning-program-axbbe?showMiniModal=true&attemptSSOLogin=true&productType=course&productId=lCUJ1UOYEe-3kxKNpReWGQ&itemId=YRHJ0\\n\\n**Content 13**\\nModule name: Module 2: Learning About Medicines\\nLesson title: What makes mRNA suitable as a medicine?\\nLesson subtitle: What makes mRNA suitable as a medicine?\\nLesson content: is can greatly accelerate the timelines to develop the apps. That is, the individual mRNA medicines. Yet another advantage of mRNA medicines is that they can be easily multiplexed, meaning that more than one mRNA can be delivered in a single medicine. This can provide the body with instructions to make multiple different proteins at the same time. Remember that some proteins act as multi-protein complexes.\\nLesson type: VIDEO\\nLesson URL: https://www.coursera.org/programs/national-elearning-center-learning-program-axbbe?showMiniModal=true&attemptSSOLogin=true&productType=course&productId=lCUJ1UOYEe-3kxKNpReWGQ&itemId=YRHJ0\\n\\n**Content 14**\\nModule name: Module 3: Applications for mRNA Medicines\\nLesson title: Non-immunogenic mRNA therapeutics\\nLesson subtitle: Non-immunogenic mRNA therapeutics\\nLesson content: lly taken up by the cells lining the airways in the lung, whose job it is to make mucus more watery. Another potential use for mRNA therapeutics is in regenerative medicine, such as stimulation of new blood vessel growth, repair of damaged muscles, or scarless wound healing.

In this module, we'll lay the foundation for understanding mRNA medicines by discussing proteins and their roles in the human body. We will delve into the molecular makeup of the human body, explore the concept of proteins from a biological perspective, and understand the process of protein synthesis. We will also discuss how proteins are essential for all biological entities, including viruses.\\nLesson type: VIDEO\\nLesson URL: https://www.coursera.org/programs/national-elearning-center-learning-program-axbbe?showMiniModal=true&attemptSSOLogin=true&productType=course&productId=lCUJ1UOYEe-3kxKNpReWGQ&itemId=ZXhyD\\n\\n**Content 24**\\nModule name: Module 2: Learning About Medicines\\nLesson title: What makes mRNA suitable as a medicine?\\nLesson subtitle: What makes mRNA suitable as a medicine?\\nLesson content: e, its effect is dose-dependent. Two, its effect is time-limited. Three, it can be dosed repeatedly. Both classic small molecule and protein medicines have all three of these properties. A limited duration of effect is particularly important because if one experiences side effects, you can simply stop taking the medicine. Let's check to see whether mRNA has the right features to be an ideal medicine.\\nLesson type: VIDEO\\nLesson URL: https://www.coursera.org/programs/national-elearning-center-learning-program-axbbe?showMiniModal=true&attemptSSOLogin=true&productType=course&productId=lCUJ1UOYEe-3kxKNpReWGQ&itemId=YRHJ0\\n\\n**Content 25**\\nModule name: Module 2: Learning About Medicines\\nLesson title: Medicines: Small molecules and proteins\\nLesson subtitle: Medicines: Small molecules and proteins\\nLesson content: o the proper location that they need to function. This is where the idea of mRNA medicines comes in. Instead of supplying the human body with a pre-made protein, we could supply just the instructions for making that protein, that is, the mRNA. This would enable our bodies to manufacture our own therapeutic proteins, and because these therapeutic proteins would be made inside our own cells, any type of protein, intracellular, membrane brand, or secreted could become a medicine.\\nLesson type: VIDEO\\nLesson URL: https://www.coursera.org/programs/national-elearning-center-learning-program-axbbe?showMiniModal=true&attemptSSOLogin=true&productType=course&productId=lCUJ1UOYEe-3kxKNpReWGQ&itemId=PNsx6\\n\\n**Content 26**\\nModule name: Module 2: Learning About Medicines\\nLesson title: Medicines: Small molecules and proteins\\nLesson subtitle: Medicines: Small molecules and proteins\\nLesson content: own cells, any type of protein, intracellular, membrane brand, or secreted could become a medicine. Sounds so simple, but of course, it's not. Our ability to use mRNA as a medicine has only recently become possible due to decades of hard work by both academics and industry researchers.

My name is Igor Halperin and I'm a Research Professor at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. I will be your instructor for this specialization. I will say a bit more about myself in a bit but first, I would like to talk about what you will get out of this specialization. First about this specialization itself. Put simply this is a specialization in machine learning that focuses exclusively on the applications of machine learning in finance. This is different from other courses that typically use a wide range of industrial applications to teach machine learning. The second very important point about this specialization is about its intended audience. I assume that you are either a financial professional or plan to become a financial professional in the near future. Therefore, this specialization is designed for practitioners or future practitioners who either work or plan to work in finance and want to learn machine learning from scratch, but using problems from finance to develop your skills. And yet finance it's all about numbers and predictions. So why don't we use financial data from the start to learn machine learning rather than use examples that have little to do with financial data? The third remark I would like to make is about examples and assignments in this specialization. Because this is a specialization for practitioners, I did my best to avoid meaningless exercises that have nothing to do with the real life. For example, we will not be doing such things as predictions of stock prices or predictions of stock indices for this sake. The reason is that even though you may have come across many blogs or research papers that discuss applications of machine learning to such problems, they have no practical uses. Therefore in order to maximize its usefulness for you, we will only be looking in this specialization at practically useful examples. So what will be your takeaways from this specialization? First, you will get a good understanding of both core concepts and most important algorithm's of machine learning from scratch. Second, you will learn all this not in abstract but rather in a very hands on way. We will put our hands on a lot of different kinds of financial data and use multiple machine learning algorithms to play with the same data. You will learn not only about classical machine learning algorithms but also get a solid understanding and practical experience of working with neural networks, including in particular the so-called deep neural networks that have recently took the industry by storm. As a result, you will develop a good intuition about both financial data and about how different algorithms perform on this data. You will know how to apply Python machine learning packages such as scikit-Learn or TensorFlow to build machine learning models for applications in quantitative trading, asset management, banking, and other fields of finance. You will be able to impress your potential employers with a portfolio of interesting and relevant projects on applications of machine learning to problems of practical interest. And more importantly, you will be able to use your knowledge to build new machine learning models using the libraries that you learned if your business need them. And this last thing I mentioned brings me to the last but not least part of your takeaway from this specialization. Machine learning is an extremely active field. Methods that are taught at schools as a cutting edge today, will become outdated tomorrow. Therefore it's important that industrial practitioners in machine learning should be able to understand as practitioners, papers in machine learning and will be able to implement them. And the best way to learn it is to read machine learning papers. Therefore our programming assignments will often have references to original publications that can be used to dig deeper into the topics we'll be covering. In addition, I will be providing references to original publications in weekly reading lists which will both help you to get a broader view of the topics to be covered and develop some practice in reading machine learning papers. So, this will be your three main takeaways after completing this specialization in machine learning in finance. In the next video, we'll talk more about the structure of this specialization.\"},\r\n     {\"title\": \"Specialization Objectives\", \"content\": \"Okay, let's continue from where we stopped the last time and talk a bit about the high level objectives that you will have in this specialization. Your first objective should be to learn the core concepts of machine learning such as types of machine learning, notions of trading count, test sets, all featuring categorization, and so on, and so forth. Second, you want to understand how specific machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, and solve work for financial problems. Further you want to learn more about neural networks maybe because you heard a lot about deep learning, and you want to find out what neural networks and deep learning are about and how they're used in finance. Next you want to get that practical experience with using Python Machine Learning libraries on financial problems including in particular, search libraries as scikit-learn for classical machinery algorithms, and library such as TensorFlow for neural models. Finally, you want to know how you would be able to expand your knowledge and learn more after you will complete this specialization. All of the above will be our objectives here and we will pursue them both in sequence by progressing through courses in this specialization. Let me explain what we will do in each one of them. Our first course is an introductory course that I called a Guided Tour of Machine Learning in Finance. This course will help you to grasp basic concepts of machine learning and understand how in general machine learning in finance differs from machine learning in the tech industry. You will learn some simple machine learning algorithms that we will use to analyze stock returns, company fundamentals, bank reports, and other financial data. All with examples that present problems of practical interest. I will show you Jupyter Notebooks that implement these simple algorithms and then you will extend them using different data in different algorithms. In this first course, we will be mostly using scikit-learn, and a few other packages to implement our machine learning solutions. Simultaneously, we will gently introduce TensorFlow, a very powerful Python package for machine learning, open source by Google about two years ago. Though our main interest in TensorFlow is due to its power of functionality for neural networks. We will start with most simple examples of using TensorFlow such as linear regression or logistic regression. What comes to using neural networks themselves, we will get a glimpse of how they work in the first course and build our simple neural network for analysis of company earnings and bank statements. During this course, we will have weekly home assignments that will include programming assignments and optional reading. The final course projects will be to apply several supervised learning algorithms to bank reports data. Don't worry now if you don't know what the term supervised learning means, we will learn it soon. Your final score for the course will be computed as a cumulative score of your weekly homework assignments and your final course project. Once you completed the first course, the four work courses cover the main topics of machine learning paradigms. For now, let me just name them for you. They are called supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Respectively, if each one of the follow up courses will extend our first course in both the depth and the implications considered. In our second course, we will go into more details of supervised and unsupervised learning, can get familiar with many key algorithms that belong in these types of machine learning. We will be talking about various types of regression and classification problems and see how they can be solved using methods such as logistic regression, support vector machines, or various types of decision trees. Then, we will turn to unsupervised learning and talk about methods of data analysis and data visualization such as principal component analysis and its extensions, clustering methods, and so on. We will also look into neural networks and see how they can be used to address the same types of tasks of supervised and unsupervised learning. On a financial side, we will be looking at many classical problems of finance such as market and regime forecasts, predictions of stock returns, portfolio optimization, etc., and show how machine learning is applied for these tasks. If you're only interested in financial implications of supervised learning or unsupervised learning, the first two courses should give you strong fundamentals in understanding core concepts and main approaches in these fields. So, that you would be able to go on and use them in real life after completing these two courses. My personal view though is that the most fascinating implications of machine learning in finance come from reinforcement learning. We will touch upon reinforcement learning in our first two courses, and we will fully devote our third course in this specialization to reinforcement learning, and its financial implications. In this course, we will talk about using of reinforcement learning to solve such classical problems of finance as portfolio optimization, optimal trading, and option pricing and risk management. This third course is a bit more technically advanced than the first two courses and we'll have a bit more math in it, but not by much. The main difference of this course from other courses on reinforcement learning, is that we will spend exactly zero time talking about such traditional examples of reinforcement learning as Tic-Tac-Toe or robotics. Instead we'll jump to financial problems right from the start and learn classical methods of reinforcement learning such as the famous Q- learning using financial problems. This will be a hands-on course where you will be implementing such algorithms and look how they work in practice. In your course project for this course, you will explore simple model for market dynamics that is obtained using reinforcement learning. After that, our final course, we'll go deeper into topics of reinforcement learning that we address in this third course. Through the fourth course, we will focus on more advanced topics, but it will be less technical than the third one, and will be structured as an overview of selected topics. The first class of topics will focus on fundamental concepts of finance such as market equilibrium, no arbitrage, predictability, and so on, and how reinforcement learning methods offer new views for such concepts. We will also talk more about market modeling cues in reinforcement learning. The second part of this last course will overview applications of reinforcement learning to high frequency trading, credit risk in peer-to-peer lending, and cryptocurrencies trading. Finally, the last thing I need to discuss before we move on with the first course in this specialization are prerequisites to this course, textbooks, and course resources.
